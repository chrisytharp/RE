Understanding our Memory Dump

It goes without saying that every operating system will store data in different places, and this is no different when data is stored within memory. Volatility is unable to assume what the operating system that we have created a memory dump is, and in turn, where to look for things and what commands can be executed. For example, hivelist is used for Windows registry and will not work on a Linux memory dump.

Whilst Volatility can't assume, it can guess. Here's where profiles come into play. In other scenarios, we would use the imageinfo plugin to help determine what profile is most suitable with the syntax of volatility -f Win7-Jigsaw.raw imageinfo. However, this could take hours to complete on a large memory dump on an Instance like that attached to the room. So instead, I have provided it for you.
Specifically, we need to identify the malicious processes to get an understanding of how the malware works and to also build a picture of Indicators of Compromise (IoC). We can list the processes that were running via pslist:

volatility -f Win7-Jigsaw.raw --profile=Win7SP1x64 pslist
